xFAQs Source Code for Firefox, Chrome and Maxthon.

Also contains old chrome and maxthon builds as they need to be packaged before submitting.

With this release all 3 versions (Firefox, Chrome) will be at the same version number.

Maxthon support is now going to be minimal as the only person I know that uses Maxthon no longer posts on GameFAQs

**Version 1.0 (Firefox and Chrome)**
* Added New Feature: Account Switcher
* Added New Feature: strikeout tags
* Added New Feature: Filter Signatures
* Added New Feature: Disable TTI in Signatures
* Added New Feature: Importing and Exporting Signatures
* code tags in signatures are now parsed as code text like they used to be
* signatures in xfaqs are formatted slightly differently and as a result, avatars to the left of a post may stretch the page.
* Old avatar domain has been removed. All avatars are now hosted on nostlagiasky.
* Users experiencing issues accessing nostlagiasky (mainly ATT customers) should not have issues anymore.
* Post Hotkey is fixed.
* About page now displays version number.

**Version 0.40 (Firefox and Chrome)**
* New news page
* Quick edit and quick topic now support all of the characters that regular posting does
* Avatars are now uploaded to both the nostlagiasky domain and older uml domain.
* Users may now select from the two domains in the options menu, however nostlagiasky is highly suggested.
* Youtube URL parsing doesn't suck as much (and may actually be perfect)

**Version 0.25 Parity (Firefox and Chrome)**
* Removed exporting signatures due it breaking xfaqs on Linux and OSX
* Implemented a new quick edit system from the ground up
* Added many tooltips describing features and common user questions
* Reworked TTI, including removing it's name, and making the options more descriptive.
* Added a default rotating sig so that specfic use cases are resolved
(Do not try posting without any sigs and Rotating Signatures enabled)


**Version 0.22**
* Added Post Filtering
* Added Tooltips for some items.
* Added Search Bar at top of board pages
* Added about page
* Added support for embedded Youtube videos
(Videos have been merged with TTI options but thumbnail size only applies to images)
