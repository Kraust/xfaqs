xFAQs Source Code for Firefox, Chrome and Maxthon.

Also contains old chrome and maxthon builds as they need to be packaged before submitting.

With this release all 3 versions (Firefox, Chrome) will be at the same version number.

Maxthon support is now going to be minimal as the only person I know that uses Maxthon no longer posts on GameFAQs

**Version 0.25 Parity (Firefox and Chrome)**
* Removed exporting signatures due it breaking xfaqs on Linux and OSX
* Implemented a new quick edit system from the ground up
* Added many tooltips describing features and common user questions
* Reworked TTI, including removing it's name, and making the options more descriptive.
* Added a default rotating sig so that specfic use cases are resolved
(Do not try posting without any sigs and Rotating Signatures enabled)


**Version 0.22**

* Added Tooltips for some items.
* Added Search Bar at top of board pages
